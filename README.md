# PyBer_Analysis

# Objectives

I have been hired by PyBer as a Data Analyst to perform an analysis on their ride-sharing data. Using this analysis, I will provide insights to show the company what areas of the business that are doing well, what areas need improvement and my recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types. 

# Results

The company has provided starter code and two csv files, containing the ride share data, which I merged together to calculate Total Rides for each city type, Total Drivers for each city type, Total Amount of Fares for each city type, Average Fare per Ride for each city type, and Average Fare per Driver for each city type. The following chart will allow you to see the results:

In rural areas, you can see they did not bring in as much as revenue which could be due to many reasons. A couple reasons being it does not have a high population so less drivers are allocated to those areas and another possible reason could be due to the fact lack of internet access or slow internet access that is casuing the numbers to be lower compared to the other two city types. Another conclusion we can make is that Suburban and Urban city types had higher revenues due to them having more drivers available due to location. The Urban City type had the highest amount of rides, drivers provided and total fares due to location. In Urban areas, you will find the population to be a lot higher and a lot of the people that use ridesharing apps are usually between the ages of 18-35 that are on the go. 

# Summary 

1. If you take a look at the chart provided, you can see that, although revenue overall for Rural areas is lower compared to their counterparts, their Average Fare per Ride is actually higher than the other two city types. This could be due to the lack of drivers in rural areas. I would try partnering with a Internet Service company in that area to see if internet is the underlying issue. If so, by partnering with them, you could assist in helping rural residents improve internet, which could possibly increase business for our company because they would be able to access our application. If that does to help increase revenue from rural areas, we could increase amount of drivers allocated to that area. 

2. In Urban city types, there are a large number of ride sharing companies that are providing the same services that we provide. As someone who uses ride sharing apps, I always look to find the most affordable and when doing so, I look for companies that are providing special promotions or offering discount codes. I would suggest for this specific city type, we consider offering special promotions. For example, 5 rides and get the 6th free upto $10. This would make us standout from our competitors that are swarming the Urban city type. 

3. Overall, I believe promoting our company would help us a great deal. You can see around April, rides took a big drop in all three city types. Do we know why that is? It could be due to summer holidays starting so Urban areas where a lot of colleges are located, lost a lot of business due to college students going home for the summer. The decrease in numbers could be due to a myraid of reasons. Marketing ourselves throughout the year with ads, billboards, etc. will help us stay in the minds of everyone even during lulls.
