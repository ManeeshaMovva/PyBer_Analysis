# PyBer_Analysis

# Objectives

I have been hired by PyBer as a Data Analyst to perform an analysis on their ride-sharing data. Using this analysis, I will provide insights to show the company what areas of the business that are doing well, what areas need improvement and my recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types. 

# Results

The company has provided starter code and two csv files, containing the ride share data, which I merged together to calculate Total Rides for each city type, Total Drivers for each city type, Total Amount of Fares for each city type, Average Fare per Ride for each city type, and Average Fare per Driver for each city type. The following chart will allow you to see my results:
